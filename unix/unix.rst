Unix Tutorial
#############

|approval_notice|

Introduction
************

Unix is a family of computer operating systems that derive from work performed
in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie,
and others. In this course, we use the term Unix to refer to systems that are
Unix-like; i.e., their user interface and basic set of utilities are
reminiscent of a Unix system.

In Unix, the primary end-user, text-based interface to the system is a program
called the *shell*. This program can be usually be accessed via a
*terminal emulator* if a graphical windowing system is available or directly
otherwise. In the shell, you enter *commands* at a *prompt*. Here is an
example of what such a prompt might look like:

.. code-block:: plain

   bash

The shell is just another way to interact with computer. These days, all
students are familiar with the point-and-click graphica windowing systems
provided in operating systems like Windows, macOS, and even phones.
However, only some realize that the windowing system they're used to is
only one way to interact with a computer.

**NOTE:** Everyone's shell prompt text might look a little different depending
on system type and user customizations. Therefore, we will use the convention
of denoting the prompt with a single `$`. Lines in this tutorial that begin with
a single `$`, therefore, are examples of commands that can be typed at a
prompt. The first `$` is **not** part of a command.
