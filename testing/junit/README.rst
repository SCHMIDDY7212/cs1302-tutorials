Unit Testing with JUnit

Introduction
============

In programming, a **unit** of code is a method or small collection of methods
(e.g., from a class or interface) that can be logically isolated in such way 
that their expectated behavior is predictable. Consider the |api_queue_offer|_
method in Java's |api_queue|_ interface, which inserts a specified element into 
a queue:

.. code-block:: java

   boolean offer (E e)

In most programming languages
 that together with any associated data, usage procedures, and operating procedures


**unit testing** is a software testing method by which individual units of source code sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating proceduresâ€”are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.
