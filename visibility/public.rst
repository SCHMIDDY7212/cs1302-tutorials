Public Visibility
*****************

Instead of saying that something has **public** visibility, we usually
just say that it's public. In Java, only top-level and member-level declarations
are allowed to be public. Things that are public are considered
to be the most visible; they are **always visible**.

===============  ==========  ============  ===========  =========
Visibility       Visible From
---------------  ------------------------------------------------
Name             Same Class  Same Package  Child Class  Elsewhere
===============  ==========  ============  ===========  =========
public           |Y|         |Y|           |Y|          |Y|
===============  ==========  ============  ===========  =========

* In Java, the ``public`` modifier must be included in a declararion for
  it to be considered public by the compiler.
* In UML, the ``+`` symbol is used just before a member's identifier to
  illustrate that it's public. It is also common practice to assume
  that a class in a UML class diagram is public if no visibility
  symbol is included.
* The ``javadoc`` program includes public declarations in a
  documentation website by default. If you want ``javadoc``
  to only include public declarations, then the ``-public``
  command-line argument can be used.
