## Introduction

## Generic Interfaces

1. Look at the [`java.lang.Comparable`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Comparable.html)
   interface. 
   
   * This generic interface is known as `Comparable<T>`, and its FQN is `java.lang.Comparable`.
   * The interface documentation goes into a lot of detail (as it should), but this interface 
     is responsible for defining the semantics of the 
     [`compareTo`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Comparable.html#compareTo-T-)
     method. 
     
   The entire interface, sans documentation, is as follows:

   ```java
   package java.lang;
   
   public interface Comparable<T> {

       public int compareTo(T o);

   } // Comparable<T>
   ```
   
1. Now let's look at the [`java.lang.String`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html)
   class, which is known to implement the `Comparable` interface. 
   
   * The class declaration for the `String` class is:
   
     ```java
     public final class String implements Serializable, Comparable<String>, CharSequence
     ```
     
     As we can see, it implements `Comparable<String>`.
     
   * Sure enough, when we look at `String` class's 
     [`compareTo`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#compareTo-java.lang.String-) 
     method, we see that `T` has been replaced with `String` as expected. Furthermore,
     we see a note that says:
     
     > `Specified by:`
     > `compareTo in interface Comparable<String>`
