# Command-Line JUnit Tutorial

![Status: Not Ready](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Not%20Ready-red.svg)

## Introduction

[JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) is programmer-friendly _unit testing framework_ and
_integration testing framework_ for Java. A **unit test** is some code that attempts to
test another, single unit of code. An **integration test** is some code that attempts to
test that different units work together. In Java, the word unit generally means method.
The JUnit framework provides the following:

* A set of static methods and annotations that make writing tests easier. Instead of
  rewriting conditionals for passing or failing a test, implementing a counter for passed
  versus failed test cases, or setting up complicated control flow scenarios to test for
  exceptions, the JUnit framework already provides these things.

* A driver program to discover and run the unit tests. This helps ensure that tests
  are run in a consistent manner with consistent output.

In this tutorial, you'll learn some of the basics of setting up and running JUnit-based
unit tests.

## Getting Started

1. Login to your Nike account.

1. Use the following command to download and execute a shell script that retrieves
   the starter code for this tutorial and places it into a subdirectory
   called `cs1302-junit`:

   ```
   $ curl -s -L https://git.io/Jes9m | bash
   ```

1. Change into the `cs1302-junit` directory that was just created and look around. You should
   see the following:

   ```
   .
   ├── bin
   ├── ConsoleLauncher
   ├── doc
   ├── lib
   │   └── junit-platform-console-standalone-1.5.2.jar
   ├── src
   └── test
   ```

1. To write and run JUnit 5 tests from the command-line you will need `ConsoleLauncher` and
   `junit-platform-console-standalone-1.5.2.jar` (version may differ). Try to use the
   `ConsoleLauncher` program:

   ```
   $ ./ConsoleLauncher --help
   ```

   **NOTE:** If you look inside the `ConsoleLauncher` file (e.g., using `cat` or `emacs`),
   you will notice that it's just a Bash script that executes the
   `junit-platform-console-standalone-1.5.2.jar` file.

1. Now, let's create a class that we can test. Create a class called `Counter` in
   `src/cs1302/junit/Counter.java` with a fully-qualified name of `cs1302.junit.Counter`.
   Use the following code:

   ```java
   package cs1302.junit;

   /**
    * A simple counter.
    */
   public class Counter {

       private long value;

       /**
        * Constructs a new {@code Counter} object with an initial value of {@code 0}.
        */
       public Counter() {
           value = 0;
       } // Counter

       /**
        * Constructs a new {@code Counter} object with an initial value
        * specified by {@code initValue}.
        * @param initValue  initial value
        * @throws IllegalArgumentException  when {@code initValue < 0}
        */
       public Counter(long initValue) {
           if (initValue < 0) {
               throw new IllegalArgumentException("initValue cannot be negative");
           } // if
           value = initValue;
       } // Counter

       /**
        * Increment the counter value by {@code 1}.
        * @throws IllegalStateException  when {@code getValue() == Long.MAX_VALUE}
        */
       public void increment() {
           if (value == Long.MAX_VALUE) {
               throw new IllegalStateException("cannot increment maxed counter");
           } // if
           value += 1;
       } // increment

       /**
        * Returns the current value of the counter.
        * @return current value of the counter
        */
       public long getValue() {
           return value;
       } // getValue

   } // Counter
   ```

1. Compile the `Counter` class, specifying `bin` as the default package for compiled
   code:

   ```
   $ javac -d bin src/cs1302/junit/Counter.java
   ```

1. Now, let's create a class with some JUnit-based unit tests. Create a class called
   `CounterTest` in `test/cs1302/junit/CounterTest.java` with a fully-qualified name of
   `cs1302.junit.CounterTEst`. While not always the case, **this test class is in the
   _same package_ as `Counter` under a _different default package_**. Please use the
   following code:

   ```java
   package cs1302.junit;

   import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
   import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

   class CounterTest {

       @Test
       void getValue1() {
           final Counter counter = new Counter();
           assertEquals(0L, counter.getValue(), "new counter should have value 0");
       } // getValue1

   } // CounterTest
   ```

   Here are some important notes:

   * The `@Test` annotation
     from [`org.junit.jupiter.api.Test`](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/Test.html)
     is used to denote that a method is a test method. JUnit looks for these methods.
     Other annotations are included in the
     [`org.junit.jupiter.api`](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/package-summary.html)
     package for different testing use cases.

   * The `assertEquals` method
     from [`org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions`](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/Assertions.html)
     is used to test that an equality should hold. The `Assertions` class contains many
     conventient static methods that you might use when testing your code.
     We used a `static import` so that we could write `assertEquals` instead of
     `Assertions.assertEquals`. For more information on static imports,
     please see [this page](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-7.html#jls-7.5.3)

   * The convention used by the official JUnit documentation is to make
     the test methods have package private visibility.

1. Compile the `CounterTest` class, specifying `bin` as the default package for compiled
   code. Since this class relies on your already-compiled `Counter` class and some
   JUnit dependencies, you need to include both `bin` and
   `junit-platform-console-standalone-1.5.2.jar` on the classpath.
   Try the following (see the note below if you have trouble):

   ```
   $ javac -cp bin:lib/junit-platform-console-standalone-1.5.2.jar \
     -d bin \
     test/cs1302/junit/CounterTest.java
   ```

   **NOTE:** The `\` at the end of each line in the previous command allows us to write
   a single command in the shell prompt using multiple lines. This can be convenient when
   typing out long commands. When typing the command, you should end a line with a single
   space followed by`\`, then immediately press the `RET` key.

1. Now let's run the test class. When using `ConsoleLauncher`, you do not need to
   manually include `junit-platform-console-standalone-1.5.2.jar` on the classpath
   (it's included automatically). You specify the class using `-c`:

   ```
   $ ./ConsoleLauncher -cp bin -c cs1302.junit.CounterTest
   ```

   Here is the output you should expect:

   ```
   + java -jar lib/junit-platform-console-standalone-1.5.2.jar -cp bin -c cs1302.junit.CounterTest

   ```

1. You can also tell `ConsoleLauncher` to run all classes that it can find on the
   classpath containing test method by specifying the `--scan-classpath` option:

   ```
   $ ./ConsoleLauncher -cp bin --scan-classpath
   ```

1. Since we'll frequently want to recompile and test our code, let's create a script
   so that we don't have to manually type out the commands. Create a regular text
   file called `test.sh` with the following contents:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash -ex

   JUNIT_JAR=lib/junit-platform-console-standalone-1.5.2.jar
   rm -rf bin/*
   javac -d bin src/cs1302/junit/Counter.java
   javac -d bin -cp bin:$JUNIT_JAR test/cs1302/junit/CounterTest.java
   ./ConsoleLauncher -cp bin --scan-classpath
   ```

   After saving the `test.sh` file, you'll need to give it user execute permission.

   ```
   $ chmod u+x test.sh
   ```

   Now test the script:

   ```
   $ ./test.sh
   ```

## Jupiter API

JUnit 5's API is known as Jupiter. When you write a JUnit test, you'll be using annotations
and methods from the Jupiter API.

1. Look at the documentation for the
   [`org.junit.jupiter.api`](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/package-summary.html)
   package. **Save a bookmark to that link!** You may need to refer to it when writing tests.

1. Look at the documentation for the
   [`org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions`](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/Assertions.html)
   class. **It has a lot of methods!** Nobody remembers them all (that's not a challenge; it's a matter
   of practicality). You should consult the documentation for an `assert` method in order to test that
   some condition holds. Here are some of the popular ones:

   | Name           | Example |
   |----------------|---------|
   | `assertTrue`   | `assertTrue(array.length > 0, "array length should be > 0");`       |
   | `assertFalse`  | `assertFalse(array.length == 0, "array length should not be 0");`   |
   | `assertEquals` | `assertEquals("Emily", person.getName());`                          |
   | `assertThrows` | `assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> list.add(""));` |

   **This is not an exhaustive list!** Remember to consult the documentation as needed. One thing
   that you should notice is that each `assert` method includes an overload with a `String` parameter
   that can be used to denote an associated message.

## Adding More Unit Tests

### Testing a Method

1. Let's test the `increment` method. Add the following test method to your `CounterTest` class:

   ```java
   @Test
   void increment1() {
       final Counter counter = new Counter();
       counter.increment();
       assertEquals(1L, counter.getValue());
   } // increment1
   ```

1. Compile and run the unit tests using the `./test.sh` script you created in the
   first part of this tutorial. As written, the method should pass the test.

1. Now, let's write a test to make sure that the `IllegalStateException` is
   correctly thrown when the counter's internal value equals `Long.MAX_VALUE`.
   Add the following test method to your `CounterTest` class:

   ```java
   @Test
   void increment2() {
       final Counter counter = new Counter(Long.MAX_VALUE);
       assertThrows(IllegalStateException, () -> counter.increment());
   } // increment2
   ```

1. Compile and run the unit tests using the `./test.sh` script you created in the
   first part of this tutorial. As written, the method should pass the test.

### Failing Tests

1. Take any of the tests we've written so far and change them so that they should
   fail.

1. Compile and run the unit tests using the `./test.sh` script you created in the
   first part of this tutorial. If you did the previous step correctly, then you
   should see one or more `✘` in the output, indicating that a test failed.

### Display Names for Tests

1. By default, JUnit will use the name of your test method as the actual test name
   in the reported output. To have JUnit use a more descriptive name, you can use
   the `@DisplayName` annotation
   from [`org.junit.jupiter.api.DisplayName`](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/DisplayName.html).
   To try this, add an import statement for `org.junit.jupiter.api.DisplayName`, then
   update the `increment2` method that we added earlier in this tutorial
   to the following:

   ```java
   @DisplayName("Incrementing a maxed out counter throws an IllegalStateException.")
   @Test
   void increment2() {
       final Counter counter = new Counter(Long.MAX_VALUE);
       assertThrows(IllegalStateException, () -> counter.increment());
   } // increment2
   ```

1. Compile and run the unit tests using the `./test.sh` script you created in the
   first part of this tutorial. You should see the following in your output
   instead of the method name:

   ```
   Incrementing a maxed out counter throws an IllegalStateException. ✔
   ```

### Parameterized Test

1. Let's write a unit test for the overloaded constructor. According the Javadoc
   comment, the overloaded constructor is expected to throw an
   `IllegalArgumentException` when `initValue < 0`. Add the following `import`
   statements to `CounterTest,java` if they are not already there:

   ```java
   import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertThrows;
   import org.junit.jupiter.api.DisplayName;
   import org.junit.jupiter.params.ParameterizedTest;
   import org.junit.jupiter.params.provider.ValueSource;
   ```

   Now add the following test method to your `CounterTest` class:

   ```java
   @DisplayName("A negative initValue value is not supported when calling the the constructor.")
   @ParameterizedTest(name = "For example, letting initValue = {0} is not supported.")
   @ValueSource(longs = { -1, -4 })
   void constructor1(long initValue) {
       assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> new Counter(initValue));
   } // constructor1
   ```

1. Compile and run the unit tests using the `./test.sh` script you created in the
   first part of this tutorial. You should see the following in your output:

   ```
   ╷
   ├─ JUnit Jupiter ✔
   │  └─ CounterTest ✔
   │     ├─ A negative initValue value is not supported. ✔
   │     │  ├─ For example, letting initValue = -1 is not supported. ✔
   │     │  └─ For example, letting initValue = -4 is not supported. ✔
   ...
   ```
